- Grid of numbered spot buttons

### Step 2: Claim a Spot

1. Find an available spot (blue button with number)
2. Click the spot you want (e.g., "5. Claim")
3. Confirm in the popup dialog
4. Your name appears on the button

```
Before: [ 5. Claim ]  (blue, available)
After:  [ @YourName ] (gray, claimed)
```

### Step 3: Check Your Spots

Click the **"My Spots"** button at the bottom of the raffle to see:
- Which spots you've claimed
- Total amount owed
- Payment status for each spot

### Step 4: Pay for Your Spots

1. Click **"My Spots"** button to see your claimed spots
2. Click **"Pay for Your Spots"** to see payment details and total amount
3. Payment instructions show here (Venmo, PayPal, Zelle info)

5. Click **"Mark as Paid"**
6. **Select your payment platform** (Venmo, PayPal, or Zelle)
